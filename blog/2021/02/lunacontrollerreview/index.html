        <p>Just got my Luna controller and was surprised to see they didn't just go with a regular box</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/1.jpg"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/1_small.jpg" alt="Amazon Luna controller in its trapezoidal box"></a>
        
        <p>It feels small even though it's about the same size as an Xbox series controller? The sticks are much lighter gray than I expected. Grips have a pretty neat texture. Face buttons are completely flat. LT, RT, LB, and RB have the biggest labels I've ever seen.</p>

        <p>Triggers are very shallow when compared to most other controllers. Almost comparable to the Steam controller? The cluster of buttons in the middle don't feel like they're using a membrane, they're closer to joycon buttons. Luna button feels extremely shallow. Dpad just feels sad.</p>

        <p>Battery cover has a piece of foam on it. Home/Luna button uses addressable RGB LEDs similar to an Echo so it can do different colors and animations. Looks nice.</p>

        <p>When in game the top part of the circle is solid purple. Blue tones are exaggerated in this picture, it's much more gentle in person.</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/13.jpg"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/13_small.jpg" alt="Luna controller in game (top of circle lit solid purple)"></a>
        
        <p>Luna has a unique mouse cursor... that isn't going away when I use the controller</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/14.jpg"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/14_small.jpg" alt="Luna's mouse cursor, a partially transparent purple circle with a white border and a white dot in the middle"></a>
        
        <p>Input latency is a thing. Action on button release. Can't figure out how to use the 1/8x speed video I took lol</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/15.mp4"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/15_small.jpg" alt="Thumbnail of a video demonstrating Luna's input latency in Grid"></a>
        
        <p>There we are. Sound looks out of sync, don't trust it. 1/8x speed, action on button release.</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/16.mp4"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/16_small.jpg" alt="Thumbnail of a slow motion video demonstrating Luna's input latency in Grid"></a>
        
        <p>Latency could depend on the game. First tests were in Grid, this is in Lumines Remastered. 1/8x speed, action on button press this time. Still don't trust the sound. No mouse cursor issues in this game.</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/17.mp4"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/17_small.jpg" alt="Thumbnail of a slow motion video demonstrating Luna's input latency in Lumines Remastered"></a>
        
        <p>Rumble isn't bad on the controller. Using rotating mass vibrators instead of Switch style LRAs but it's not overpowering or too weak.</p>
        
        <p>Unlike Stadia, the controller disconnects when you're not in a game (on desktop at least). It stays on but you can't use it to navigate the menus.</p>
        
        <p>Input latency in Control is pretty bad. Video is full speed, action on button press.</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/18.mp4"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/18_small.jpg" alt="Thumbnail of a video demonstrating Luna's input latency in Control"></a>
        
        <p>Keyboard comparison. Video full speed, action on keypress.</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/19.mp4"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/19_small.jpg" alt="Thumbnail of a video demonstrating Luna's input latency in Control"></a>
        
        <p>Not sure if the audio on these is synced or not but our brains are weird anyway and interpret vision and hearing with different delays so just go by sight</p>
        
        <p>This isn't a connection speed thing btw. Will compare to Stadia later. Reminder that Luna is still in beta and things are expected to change before release.</p>

        <p>I saw some Xbox colored button prompts earlier but didn't want to jump to conclusions. This button prompt is Xbox specific though, so we can safely guess that these games are accepting Luna controller input as if it's an Xbox controller.</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/21.jpg"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/21_small.jpg" alt='Xbox recents/back/"box box" button prompt'></a>
        
        <p>Smart move by Amazon to minimize friction for game developers but it's kinda weird when the corresponding button has a circle on it. Manual calls if the action button.</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/22.jpg"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/22_small.jpg" alt="Front of Luna controller showing the center button cluster"></a>

        <p>While I have the box off the shelf, here's the back of the Luna controller box and the back of the Stadia premiere edition box. Just a little similar lol</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/24.jpg"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/24_small.jpg" alt='Back of Luna controller box: "For the love of play" with a picture of the Luna controller
Back of Stadia premiere edition box: "One place for all the ways we play."'></a>
        
        <p>Well this is a little confusing. Pretty sure the game crashed.</p>
        <a href="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/25.jpg"><img class="blog" src="/blog/2021/02/lunacontrollerreview/25_small.jpg" alt='Luna claiming "connection terminated due to poor network" and "something went wrong on our end" at the same time'></a>
        
        <p>Got caught up playing Control and didn't get to the Stadia comparison lol. Will test both tomorrow so network conditions aren't different between the tests.</p>
        
        <p>Stadia input latency in Doom 2016, video 1/8x speed, action on button press, don't trust the desynced audio</p>

        <p>Luna input latency in Control retested for a fair comparison, video 1/8x speed, action on button press, don't trust the desynced audio</p>
